    And now, a comparison of the computational complexity of different possible algorithms...

    Definitions:
      N events per pixel
      M different pixels
      G ghost pixels per incoming pixel
      B histogramming bins.

    ALGORITHM A:
     - Sort input N events by TOF: time = M * (N log N)
     - For M pixels, go through N events (sorted by TOF)
       - For each event, find the bin; time = 1, max = B
       - Generate G ghost pixels per incoming event. They all have same TOF, therefore share the bin.
         - For each ghost, find the group to which it belongs; time = 1 (array lookup)
         - Increment the given bin by the weight of the bin; time = 1
     - Final complexity:  MN log N + 2*MNG
     - This algorithm CANNOT give you the ungrouped (unfocussed) pixels

    ALGORITHM B:
     - Make a reverse map of ghosting (with key of the output pixel #, find a list of input ghost-causing pixels).
     - Sort input N events by TOF: time = M * (N log N)
     - For M output pixels
       - For G ghost-causing pixels in the output
         - Add the N weighted events to a list; time=1
       - Sort the (fractional) events by TOF; time = GN log G log N
       - Perform the binning; time = GN
     - Final complexity: MN log N + 2*MGN + MGN log G log N
     - This algorithm CAN give you the ungrouped (unfocussed) pixels, if you have the memory!
