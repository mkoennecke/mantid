Description
-----------

This algorithm is used for finding Goniometer angles when instrument
readings are basically unknown. The inputs are two PeaksWorkspaces
corresponding to sample orientations of the SAME crystal that differ
only in their phi rotation.

If the phi angles are known, this algorithm attempts to find the common
chi and omega rotations.
